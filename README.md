# go-hello
casual "Hello, world" program

No "Hello, world" program - not a developer

Also try run it in Docker for first conscious time (not just using some ready commands).

In terminal:\
docker build -t(for adding name to docker img) docker-hello(name of docker img) .(path to project)

Run in docker:\
docker run --name=go-hello -p 80:4000 docker-hello
